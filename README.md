As an entrepreneur, I work with a tremendous amount of data in the form of content, posts, excel files, word files, etc

at first to save time I used to save all the files in my business folder but as time went on, 

I found myself at the hurdles of files and as a result, my labels, and content files got misplaced

but then a Python automation course came into being and I got to know about a module named Shutill

a straightforward yet exciting module that automatically moves different file formats (png, jpeg, txt,xlsx) to their respective folders

the coding is so simple that it only takes the path to which the file is supposed to go and the format of the file

which made my work a ton easier now I know which folder to look for my work...
